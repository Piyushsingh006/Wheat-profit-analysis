## Wheat-Profit-EDA-and-Lasso-Model

An end-to-end data analytics project involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling on wheat profitability data.


## 🌾 Project Overview
This project analyzes wheat farming profitability using a Kaggle dataset. The workflow includes data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, visualization, and predictive modeling using Lasso Regression.

## 📊 Key Insights

1.Wheat profit per acre shows a long-term upward trend (1998–2024).

2.Profitability is volatile year-to-year due to external factors.

3.Northern Crescent and Fruitful Rim are the most profitable regions.

4.Mississippi Portal and Prairie Gateway are the least profitable.

5.Both Total Cost and Gross Value have increased over time.

6.Profit margins generally remain above 45%.

## 🤖 Modeling

Trained and tuned a Lasso Regression model for profit prediction.

Lasso aided in feature selection and model interpretability.
